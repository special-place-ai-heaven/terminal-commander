# TC42 - Registry Hot Activation And Rule Binding

Use this file directly with `/goal`:

    /goal .agent/goals/terminal-commander-runtime/TC42-registry-hot-activation-and-rule-binding.md

## Goal File Workflow

0. Use the Branch Guard below before editing this goal file, source code, migrations, docs, tests, or generated artifacts.
1. After Branch Guard passes, update this file's frontmatter: set `status` to `In progress` and set `started_at` to an ISO-8601 timestamp.
2. Execute only this goal's mini-spec. Keep changes inside `allowed_files_or_area` and stop if a stop condition is hit.
3. If acceptance criteria pass, run the verification command(s), commit the verified work, then update this file: set `status` to `Completed`, set `completed_at`, and set `completion_commit` to the exact verified work commit hash.
4. Commit the goal-status update as a separate commit unless repository policy says otherwise.
5. If blocked, set `status` to `Blocked`, set `blocked_reason`, leave `completion_commit` empty unless a verified partial commit exists, and record the blocker in the final report.

## Branch Guard

This goal belongs only to branch:

```text
main
```

Before changing anything, run:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
```

The branch output must be exactly:

```text
main
```

If the current branch is one of the prohibited branches, or anything other than `main`, do not edit there. Switch to or create the correct worktree/branch, then rerun this Branch Guard. Stop if the correct branch/worktree is unavailable, dirty with unrelated work, or still does not print `main`.

## Mission Context

- Target project: https://github.com/special-place-administrator/terminal-commander
- Goal chain: terminal-commander-runtime
- Source material: current `main` repository, uploaded BACKLOG/EVIDENCE/FINAL reports, and this runtime-pivot chain.
- Current known state: TC01a-TC32 are reported complete and merged to `main`; real-deployment P0 items remain around rmcp stdio, PTY spawn, UDS IPC, and persistent audit writes.
- Desired end state: Terminal Commander becomes a provider-neutral MCP realtime signal abstraction layer where LLMs control probes/tools and receive only structured signal, bounded context, and searchable file/terminal intelligence.

## Mini-Spec

objective:
- Make registry rule selection/creation/testing/activation affect live probe runtimes by unique rule IDs, not only the persistent registry database.

non_goals:
- Do not invent a general plugin language.
- Do not allow arbitrary code execution as a rule.
- Do not implement provider-specific prompt engineering or hooks.

allowed_files_or_area:
- crates/store/src/registry.rs
- crates/store/src/import.rs
- crates/sifters/src/**
- crates/daemon/src/runtime.rs
- crates/daemon/src/router.rs
- crates/daemon/src/ipc.rs
- crates/mcp/src/**
- rules/**
- docs/rules/**
- docs/mcp/**
- tests/**/registry*
- tests/**/sifter*

forbidden_files:
- PTY spawn implementation
- file search/index implementation
- network listeners
- unsafe regex engines without bounded execution guards

contracts_or_interfaces:
- Rules have stable unique IDs and versions.
- LLM can registry_search, registry_get, registry_create, registry_test, registry_activate, and bind selected rules to a bucket/probe/session.
- Activation must hot-load or rebuild runtime rule sets for affected probes without reading raw stream history unless explicitly bounded.
- Unsafe regex/rule definitions must be rejected or capped.

invariants:
- The product is a realtime signal channel and abstraction layer for LLM agents, not a raw terminal/log dumping tool.
- MCP-facing code must not be an unrestricted root shell and must not spawn commands directly.
- No network listener, no setuid helper, no polkit/system-service install behavior unless a later explicit goal authorizes it.
- Responses visible to the LLM must be bounded, structured, and source-status honest.
- Raw terminal/file output is unavailable by default; bounded context is available only through pointers, file windows, or explicit capped reads.
- Every severity >= Medium signal event must have a source pointer or a pointer_unavailable_reason.
- Do not treat mock, test-only, scaffold-only, degraded, unknown, or disabled behavior as live success.

scope_substitution_policy:
- If the exact implementation path is impossible on the current host, do not silently substitute. Record the reason, source evidence, lost behavior, new source-status, and backlog priority in this goal file and final report.
- A substitute is only acceptable when it preserves the LLM-visible contract: bounded output, policy gate, auditability, source pointer/context, and no raw stream by default.

implementation_steps:
- Audit existing registry persistence and sifter runtime build path.
- Define runtime activation binding model: rule_id, version, bucket_id/probe_id/session, status, activated_at.
- Implement registry_test over samples and current rule validator.
- Implement registry_activate so future stream frames use the rule.
- Expose live registry tools via MCP.
- Add tests where an LLM-created rule is activated while a command/probe is running or before start and emits signal.

acceptance_criteria:
- A created/tested/activated rule affects emitted events in a runtime test.
- Activation records are persisted/audited.
- Bad regex/rules are rejected with bounded error messages.
- Tool docs explain how an LLM picks or creates registry IDs.

evidence_required:
- Branch evidence: `git branch --show-current` output exactly `main`.
- File paths changed.
- Verification command output summary.
- Any new public type, API, route, migration, feature flag, environment variable, event, or status enum introduced.
- Explicit source-status notes for live, partial, degraded, disabled, test-only, mock, blocked, unknown, or deleted behavior touched.
- Evidence that bounded-output and pointer invariants remain true for every LLM-visible response touched by this goal.

stop_conditions:
- Current branch is not exactly `main`.
- The goal requires touching forbidden files.
- The goal expands into another goal's scope.
- A required interface, route, package, repository path, migration path, branch, or runtime dependency is missing or contradicts this mini-spec.
- Verification cannot run for a reason that is not clearly pre-existing and documented.
- A security, credential, data-retention, privacy, production-safety, or destructive-change question appears that is not answered by this goal file.
- A change would create an unbounded raw-output path to the LLM.

verification_command:
```bash
git diff --check
cargo metadata --no-deps
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --workspace
```

## Task Prompt

Run TC42 only on branch `main`. Complete the objective above, stay inside the allowed files/areas, respect all forbidden files and invariants, verify the work, commit only verified changes, update this goal file's status fields, and report blockers instead of guessing.

## Final Report Format
