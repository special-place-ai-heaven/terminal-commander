# TC06 - Core Identifiers Events And Source Pointers

Use this file directly with `/goal`:

    /goal .agent/goals/terminal-commander-mvp/TC06-core-identifiers-events-and-source-pointers.md

## Goal File Workflow

0. Use the Branch Guard below before editing this goal file, source code, migrations, docs, tests, or generated artifacts.
1. After Branch Guard passes, update this file's frontmatter: set `status` to `In progress` and set `started_at` to an ISO-8601 timestamp.
2. Execute only this goal's mini-spec. Keep changes inside `allowed_files_or_area` and stop if a stop condition is hit.
3. If acceptance criteria pass, run the verification command(s), commit the verified work, then update this file: set `status` to `Completed`, set `completed_at`, and set `completion_commit` to the exact verified work commit hash.
4. Commit the goal-status update as a separate commit unless the repository policy says otherwise.
5. If blocked, set `status` to `Blocked`, set `blocked_reason`, leave `completion_commit` empty unless a verified partial commit exists, and record the blocker in the final report.

## Branch Guard

This goal belongs only to branch:

```text
feature/terminal-commander-mvp
```

Before changing anything, run:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
```

The branch output must be exactly:

```text
feature/terminal-commander-mvp
```

If the current branch is one of the prohibited branches, or anything other than `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`, do not edit there. Switch to or create the correct worktree/branch, then rerun this Branch Guard. Stop if the correct branch/worktree is unavailable, dirty with unrelated work, or still does not print `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`.

## Mission Context

- Target project: `https://github.com/special-place-administrator/terminal-commander.git`
- Goal chain: `terminal-commander-mvp`
- Source material: user-provided Terminal Commander concept, confirmed branch policy, initial README already added by user, and the Terminal Commander product specification produced in the planning session.
- Current known state: repository is new and user reports it contains the initial README.md; all code, tests, registry, daemon, MCP server, probes, and packaging are otherwise unverified or absent.
- Desired end state: a provider-neutral MCP-operated local signal-combing layer that can run commands, observe terminal/file sources, dynamically manage rules, expose realtime signal buckets, and provide bounded context without raw noisy output.

## Mini-Spec

objective:
- Implement the core typed identifiers, severity enum, event model, source descriptor, and source pointer types with serialization and tests.

non_goals:
- Do not implement bucket storage, probes, registry persistence, daemon APIs, or MCP tools.
- Do not parse terminal streams or execute commands.
- Do not expose raw output APIs.

allowed_files_or_area:
- .agent/goals/terminal-commander-mvp/TC06-core-identifiers-events-and-source-pointers.md
- crates/terminal-commander-core/Cargo.toml
- crates/terminal-commander-core/src/**
- crates/terminal-commander-core/tests/**

forbidden_files:
- Any path outside `allowed_files_or_area` except this goal file status update if not already listed.
- Secrets, credentials, private keys, token caches, or environment files containing secrets.
- Generated binaries, build outputs, vendored dependencies, or large log artifacts.
- Unrelated application behavior, unrelated documentation, or unrelated repository restructuring.

contracts_or_interfaces:
- Typed IDs must exist for job, probe, bucket, event, rule, source, frame, activation, and session where applicable.
- SignalEvent serialization must be compatible with docs/contracts event fixture from TC05 or document intentional differences.
- Source pointers must support frame_id, optional line, optional byte_start/byte_end, stream name, and context availability.

invariants:
- No unbounded raw terminal or file output may be exposed as a success path.
- Every signal event design or implementation must preserve a bounded source pointer or explain why no pointer can exist.
- Every public contract must be documented or tested before it is treated as live.
- No mock, stub, placeholder, TODO-only, disabled, degraded, or unknown behavior may be reported as completed functionality.
- Security-sensitive operations must be policy-gated and auditable when they are introduced.

implementation_steps:
- Add typed ID newtypes or equivalent strongly typed wrappers in terminal-commander-core.
- Implement Severity enum with debug, info, low, medium, high, critical ordering semantics.
- Implement SignalEvent, EventSource, RuleRef, SourcePointer, and related serializable structures.
- Add constructors or validation helpers that prevent empty IDs and invalid severity ordering assumptions.
- Add unit tests and JSON serialization tests using TC05 fixtures where practical.

acceptance_criteria:
- Core event-related types compile and have unit tests.
- Severity ordering tests prove filtering by minimum severity is deterministic.
- Serialization tests compare at least one event fixture or produce documented compatible output.
- No daemon, probe, MCP, or storage behavior is added.
- No unbounded raw output field is added to SignalEvent.

evidence_required:
- Branch evidence: `git branch --show-current` output exactly `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`.
- File paths changed.
- Verification command output summary.
- Any new public type, API, route, migration, feature flag, environment variable, event, or status enum introduced.
- Explicit source-status notes for live, partial, degraded, disabled, test-only, mock, blocked, unknown, or deleted behavior touched.

stop_conditions:
- Current branch is not exactly `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`.
- The goal requires touching forbidden files.
- The goal expands into another goal's scope.
- A required interface, route, package, repository path, migration path, branch, or runtime dependency is missing or contradicts this mini-spec.
- Verification cannot run for a reason that is not clearly pre-existing and documented.
- A security, credential, data-retention, privacy, production-safety, or destructive-change question appears that is not answered by this goal file.

verification_command:
```bash
git diff --check
cargo fmt --check
cargo test -p terminal-commander-core
```

## Task Prompt

Run TC06 only on branch `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`. Complete the objective above, stay inside the allowed files/areas, respect all forbidden files and invariants, verify the work, commit only verified changes, update this goal file's status fields, and report blockers instead of guessing.

## Final Report Format

Objective:
- Implement the core typed identifiers, severity enum, event model, source descriptor, and source pointer types with serialization and tests.

Changes:
- <focused list of implementation changes>

Files changed:
- <paths>

Verification:
- PASS/FAIL: `<command>` — <summary>

Evidence:
- <source-status notes, test output summaries, route/status evidence, screenshots only if rendered UI changed>

Commit:
- Verified work commit: `<hash or none>`
- Goal status commit: `<hash or none>`

Known gaps / blockers:
- <none or explicit blocker>

Next goal:
- TC07 and TC07-in-memory-bucket-manager.md
