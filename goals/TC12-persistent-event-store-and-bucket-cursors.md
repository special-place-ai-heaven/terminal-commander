# TC12 - Persistent Event Store And Bucket Cursors

> Frozen 2026-05-28 as historical record. Live status tracked in `.agent/goals/terminal-commander-runtime/` and `docs/release/MVP_EVIDENCE_REVIEW.md`. Do not edit.

Use this file directly with `/goal`:

    /goal .agent/goals/terminal-commander-mvp/TC12-persistent-event-store-and-bucket-cursors.md

## Goal File Workflow

0. Use the Branch Guard below before editing this goal file, source code, migrations, docs, tests, or generated artifacts.
1. After Branch Guard passes, update this file's frontmatter: set `status` to `In progress` and set `started_at` to an ISO-8601 timestamp.
2. Execute only this goal's mini-spec. Keep changes inside `allowed_files_or_area` and stop if a stop condition is hit.
3. If acceptance criteria pass, run the verification command(s), commit the verified work, then update this file: set `status` to `Completed`, set `completed_at`, and set `completion_commit` to the exact verified work commit hash.
4. Commit the goal-status update as a separate commit unless the repository policy says otherwise.
5. If blocked, set `status` to `Blocked`, set `blocked_reason`, leave `completion_commit` empty unless a verified partial commit exists, and record the blocker in the final report.

## Branch Guard

This goal belongs only to branch:

```text
feature/terminal-commander-mvp
```

Before changing anything, run:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
```

The branch output must be exactly:

```text
feature/terminal-commander-mvp
```

If the current branch is one of the prohibited branches, or anything other than `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`, do not edit there. Switch to or create the correct worktree/branch, then rerun this Branch Guard. Stop if the correct branch/worktree is unavailable, dirty with unrelated work, or still does not print `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`.

## Mission Context

- Target project: `https://github.com/special-place-administrator/terminal-commander.git`
- Goal chain: `terminal-commander-mvp`
- Source material: user-provided Terminal Commander concept, confirmed branch policy, initial README already added by user, and the Terminal Commander product specification produced in the planning session.
- Current known state: repository is new and user reports it contains the initial README.md; all code, tests, registry, daemon, MCP server, probes, and packaging are otherwise unverified or absent.
- Desired end state: a provider-neutral MCP-operated local signal-combing layer that can run commands, observe terminal/file sources, dynamically manage rules, expose realtime signal buckets, and provide bounded context without raw noisy output.

## Mini-Spec

objective:
- Implement persistent event storage and bucket cursor queries using the chosen storage backend while preserving bounded reads.

non_goals:
- Do not implement registry persistence in this goal.
- Do not implement daemon process management or MCP server tools.
- Do not persist raw unbounded terminal output in the event store.

allowed_files_or_area:
- .agent/goals/terminal-commander-mvp/TC12-persistent-event-store-and-bucket-cursors.md
- crates/terminal-commander-store/Cargo.toml
- crates/terminal-commander-store/src/**
- crates/terminal-commander-store/tests/**
- crates/terminal-commander-core/src/**
- docs/storage/**

forbidden_files:
- Any path outside `allowed_files_or_area` except this goal file status update if not already listed.
- Secrets, credentials, private keys, token caches, or environment files containing secrets.
- Generated binaries, build outputs, vendored dependencies, or large log artifacts.
- Unrelated application behavior, unrelated documentation, or unrelated repository restructuring.

contracts_or_interfaces:
- Persistent bucket reads must be cursor-based and bounded like the in-memory bucket manager.
- Events must be stored append-only per bucket with monotonic seq values.
- Storage schema and migrations must be documented before being treated as live.

invariants:
- No unbounded raw terminal or file output may be exposed as a success path.
- Every signal event design or implementation must preserve a bounded source pointer or explain why no pointer can exist.
- Every public contract must be documented or tested before it is treated as live.
- No mock, stub, placeholder, TODO-only, disabled, degraded, or unknown behavior may be reported as completed functionality.
- Security-sensitive operations must be policy-gated and auditable when they are introduced.

implementation_steps:
- Choose and document the MVP event storage backend in docs/storage/EVENT_STORE.md if not already selected.
- Implement event store initialization and migration or schema creation for bucket metadata and event rows.
- Implement append_event, events_since, get_event, and bucket_summary operations.
- Add tests using a temporary database or isolated test directory.
- Verify that serialized event fields do not include unbounded raw output.

acceptance_criteria:
- Persistent store can append and read events by bucket cursor.
- events_since enforces a maximum result limit.
- get_event can retrieve a stored event by event_id.
- Storage tests run without external services and clean up temporary files.
- docs/storage/EVENT_STORE.md documents schema, retention assumptions, and limitations.

evidence_required:
- Branch evidence: `git branch --show-current` output exactly `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`.
- File paths changed.
- Verification command output summary.
- Any new public type, API, route, migration, feature flag, environment variable, event, or status enum introduced.
- Explicit source-status notes for live, partial, degraded, disabled, test-only, mock, blocked, unknown, or deleted behavior touched.

stop_conditions:
- Current branch is not exactly `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`.
- The goal requires touching forbidden files.
- The goal expands into another goal's scope.
- A required interface, route, package, repository path, migration path, branch, or runtime dependency is missing or contradicts this mini-spec.
- Verification cannot run for a reason that is not clearly pre-existing and documented.
- A security, credential, data-retention, privacy, production-safety, or destructive-change question appears that is not answered by this goal file.

verification_command:
```bash
git diff --check
cargo fmt --check
cargo test -p terminal-commander-store event_store
```

## Task Prompt

Run TC12 only on branch `feature/terminal-commander-mvp`. Complete the objective above, stay inside the allowed files/areas, respect all forbidden files and invariants, verify the work, commit only verified changes, update this goal file's status fields, and report blockers instead of guessing.
